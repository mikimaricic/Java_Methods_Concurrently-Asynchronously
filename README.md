# Java_Methods_Concurrently-Asynchronously
Simple java program with 2 methods. One method prints “Hello” and the other method prints “World”. Both methods are invoked at the same instant, not one after the other. So on console you should sometimes see “World Hello” and sometimes “Hello World” depending on which method is invoked first. Repeat these calls every 10 seconds and stop after 1 minute.
